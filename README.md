# Toggle Required Metadata Plugin

This plugin makes it possible to make the **Affiliation**, **ORCID**  and  **Biography Statement** fields required for the submissions authors to fill in.

These fields belong to the Contributor of the Submission.

When the [ORCID Profile Plugin](https://github.com/pkp/orcidProfile) is enabled (recommended), the ORCID field can't be made required.

## Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with the following PKP applications:

* OJS 3.3.0 and 3.4.0
* OPS 3.4.0
* OMP 3.4.0

## Installation

Install the **Toggle Required Metadata** plugin via the **Plugin Gallery** in **Dashboard > Website > Plugins**

## Settings

By default, both fields are made required. But it is possible to set it different:

1. After the plugin is installed, go to the plugin settings:
![plugin-settings-section](/assets/plugin-settings-section.png)

2. Select the metadata to be required:
![plugin-settings](/assets/plugin-settings.png)

3. The selected metadata are going to be required fields in the Submission's Contributor form:
![plugin-in-action](/assets/application.png)
